## Cursor Systems
This repo contains some simple rule based systems that will make cursor much easier to work with and increase reliability.

Systems currently included:

1. Knowledge retrieval and storage system
This system encourages cursor to store and retrieve information about your project as it works, to ensure consistency in its understanding.

2. Task execution system
This system encourages cursor to work like a software development team would, defining tasks and tracking them as it  goes. This system makes it easier to not only manage the way cursor will work, but also ensure that resuming a task is more reliable in results (such as when a task is left unfinished and returned to later, or when a new chat is started and contextual information is lost)



## How to use
Simply drop the rules into your cursor rules folder, and drop the docs folder into your project

Read the rules to understand how the systems work. MAKE SURE THE RULES ARE SET TO AUTO APPLY ALL THE TIME.

The scope rule is optional, but I find it reduces a lot of noise that cursor is prone to make.
